## ??? Step-by-Step Release Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Build

1. **Clean and Build Release Version**
   ```bash
   # Run the build script
   build_release.bat

     - AI assistant opens (F2)
     - UI is responsive
   - Try both with and without AI configuration

3. **Create Release ZIP**
   ```bash
   # If you have 7zip installed, the script will offer to create ZIP
   # Otherwise, manually zip the build/release/ folder
   # Name: MistEngine-v0.1.0-pre-alpha-win64.zip
   ```

### Step 2: GitHub Repository Setup
