## ?? **Development Guidelines**

### **Code Style**
```cpp
// Follow existing patterns
class MyComponent {
public:
    // Public members first
    void Update(float deltaTime);
    
private:
    // Private members with m_ prefix
    float m_deltaAccumulator = 0.0f;
};

// Use modern C++14 features
auto enemies = std::make_unique<std::vector<Entity>>();
auto weapon = gCoordinator.GetComponent<WeaponComponent>(entity);
```

### **Architecture Principles**
- **ECS First** - Use Entity-Component-System for new features
- **Memory Safety** - RAII and smart pointers required
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- **Performance** - Profile and optimize critical paths
- **Modularity** - Design for plugin integration

### **Testing Standards**
- **Unit Tests** for critical functionality
- **Integration Tests** for system interactions
- **Manual Testing** in FPS game mode
- **Performance Testing** for optimization features
